KNOWN BUGS

~Sometimes, in the information window, the descriptions overlap. 

~Clicking the "Go Back" button takes an extra click.

~Enemies are not centered on the battlefield when the total number of columns is even.

~If you chain an enemy succcessfully, and the enemy dies, the chain goes away (which is good), BUT you do not get another turn (which is not).
